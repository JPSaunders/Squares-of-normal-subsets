The file InvolutionCheck.mg is for use with Magma and will verify that for all almost simple groups with socle listed in Groupnames and for all conjugacy classes C in said group, there exists a class D of involutions such that CD contains an element of order divisible by 4. If one does not have access to Magma, the GAP function found in "InvolutionCheck.g" may also be applied to these groups but one will have to determine the GAP names of these groups first. As it stands, "InvolutionCheck.g" does the same task but only for almost simple groups with socle ${}^2\mathrm{E}_6(2)$.

The file SquareCheck.g verifies Conjecture 1.7 for ATLAS groups, provided the character tables exist in GAP (or can be imported from Magma). To run the file properly, edit "workdir" in SquareCheck.g so that it points to the folder containing the computed tables from magma and read the file into GAP. The folder "magmatables" contains character tables exported from Magma for certain groups whose character tables did not exist (or I simply could not find) in my installation of GAP.

Conjecture 1.7: Suppose $G = \mathrm{Inn}(G)$ is a non-abelian finite simple group and assume that $\alpha \in \mathrm{Aut}(G).$ Then there exists $x \in \alpha G$ such that $C = x^G$ satisfies $C^2 = \alpha^2 G$.
